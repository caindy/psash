a modern Windows-friendly alternative to bash that leverages PowerShell

Goals:
-------
* Address common short-comings when interacting with the shell (copy/paste)
* Bundling oft used extensions and applications 
** Git Bash
** Git PowerShell Extensions
** PSCX
** Chocolatey
* Simplify switching between modes (.NET 4, bash, command.com)
* Modernize the "terminal" experience 

IMPORTANT:
This is pre-alpha.  I'm only committing to Github at this time as a backup.

USAGE:
--------
Windows + ` : this toggles visibility of the shell
To execute a command, highlight the text and hit SHIFT + ENTER
